# Shader Graph Custom Lighting
Some custom lighting functions/sub-graphs for Shader Graph, Universal Render Pipeline. v8.3.1, Unity 2020.1.17f1.
(Hopefully works in other versions? If anything breaks, let me know by opening an issue)

Includes Sub Graphs for :
- **Main Light**
  - Outputs : Direction (Vector3), Colour (Vector4), Distance Atten (Vector1/Float)
- **Main Light Shadows**
  - Inputs : World Position (Vector3)
  - Outputs : Shadow Atten (Vector1)
  - **Important Note : Will only work in an Unlit Graph if Shadow Cascades is 2 or higher on the URP Asset (possibly all URP assets in project). It will error with No Cascades / 1 Cascade.** See CustomLighting.hlsl for more information. (If you have troubles when building, try Build instead of Build And Run)
- **Ambient** (uses per-pixel SampleSH, use add node to apply this. Alternatively use the Baked GI node instead of this one)
  - Outputs : Ambient (Vector3)
- **Mix Fog** (applies fog to the colour, should be used just before outputting colour to master)
  - Inputs : Colour (Vector3)
  - Outputs : Out (Vector3, Colour with fog applied)
- **Additional Lights** (Loops through each additional light, point, spotlights, etc, Handling diffuse, specular and shadows. For custom lighting models, you'll need to copy this function and edit it due to the loop, e.g. swap the LightingLambert and LightingSpecular functions out for custom ones. Also see the AdditionalLightsToon function as an example)
  - Inputs : Spec Colour (Vector3), Smoothness (Vector1)
  - Outputs : Diffuse (Vector3), Specular (Vector3)
- **Blinn-Phong Specular** (handles specular lighting using the [Blinn-Phong model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn%E2%80%93Phong_reflection_model). Note the Specular result should be multiplied by the main light distance atten and colour. This isn't done inside the sub graph in order to allow the specular result to be edited, e.g. using a ramp texture like in the toon example)
  - Inputs : Smoothness (Vector1)
  - Outputs : Specular (Vector1), Light Colour (Vector3), Distance Atten (Vector1),
- **Phong Specular** (same as above, but uses the less efficient [Phong model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model)).
  - Inputs : Smoothness (Vector1)
  - Outputs : Specular (Vector1), Light Colour (Vector3), Distance Atten (Vector1)

Included Examples :
- **Toon (Main Light & optional Additional Lights)**
- **Shadow Receiver** (Transparent object that receives shadows and can set their colour. Can turn off casting via Mesh Renderer)
